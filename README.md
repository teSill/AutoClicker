This is a very light auto clicker with traditional auto clicker functionalities and a little more!

- Clicking types supported:
  - Left clicking
  - Right clicking
  - Simultaneous clicking of both left and right mouse clicks
- Click intervals can be randomized between with a value of 5-100% (eg. a 1 second click interval with a 100% randomization would return a value between 0.5s and 2s)
- On top of auto clicking where your mouse currently is, you can also set up to custom click positions which the program will iterate over in order
