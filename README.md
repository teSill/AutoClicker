Temsei Auto Clicker is a reliable lightweight auto clicker that can be used to complete both traditionally simple left and right click operations, but also set-up to perform infinitely complex click sequences. 

Main Features
  - Regular Settings
    - Left clicking, right clicking and simultaneous clicking of them both
    - Set up your own click intervals (very fast clicking speeds can be achieved)
    - Randomize your click intervals
    - Holding down of left and right mouse buttons
  - Advanced Settings
    - Create customizable clicking lists
    - Add click positions to your lists either one at a time, or record lengthy clicking sequences
    - Achieve infinitely complex clicking operations by combining your lists with the "Automate" button, where they will run in order until manually stopped
    - Modify the names of your lists to keep things clean and organized
    - Set clicking intervals of individual lists
    - Ability to make your lists only run once before the thread automatically terminates
    - Save and load your lists to quickly get back into the action!
